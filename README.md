# Decryptex
Yet Another crazy and aggresive deobfuscator for javascript that would try to deobfuscate anything around it.

*DWYOR* I just make this in my spare time, and this was the thing and logic i use to easily deobfuscate any javascript code.

Run : 
```
1. Save as the file from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jokogendeng77/Decryptex/main/decrypt.js'
2. Run it using node decrypt.js
```

What parameters available : 
```
Check it by running node decrypt.js -h
```

## TODO :
